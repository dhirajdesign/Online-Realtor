# How to compile the project

We use Apache Maven to compile and run this project. 

You need to install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)  on your system. 

Type on the command line: 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

# How to create a binary runnable package 


```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```


# How to run

```bash
mvn -q clean compile exec:java -Dexec.executable="edu.bu.met.cs665.Main" -Dlog4j.configuration="file:log4j.properties"
```

We recommand the above command for running the project. 

Alternativly, you can run the following command. It will generate a single jar file with all of the dependencies. 

```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single

java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j.properties -classpath ./target/JavaProjectTemplate-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar  edu.bu.met.cs665.Main
```


# Run all the unit test classes.


```bash
mvn clean compile test

```
